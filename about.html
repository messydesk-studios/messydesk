<p class="about">Hello, my name is Lucas! I am a passionate animator and coder and I like to play the piano often. In Scratch I go by <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/MessyDesk-studios/">Messydesk-studios</a> and I've been making projects on scratch for over 3 years. You may know me as the animator and composer of the Middle School Musical, co-creator of the Animator Battles, programmer of Save your fries and a former member of Aboomistudio! I've been working on my own projects for quite a few years so far and I hope to make some more in the future. Outside of Messydesk-studios, I mostly scooter, do jujitsu, hangout with my friends and play on my Game Boy Advance®.</p>

History
</div>
<h3 class="historytitle">Early years</h3>
<p>Around the fall of 2020, I got a tutor to teach me scratch while I was in lockdown. My first game was a tag game made in my old scratch account <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/lucasm30/">lucasm30</a>. Later that day, I started working on my very first animation. It was a small cartoon of people dancing to the ducktales moon theme called "<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/417792739/">Master Dancer</a>".</p>

<p>After my course finished, I haven't really done any coding for a while. Although, on after my friend introduced me to gumball, I was inspired to make my own animation. Which is how I came up with the idea of Renchwood during the late 2021. I was also interested in making stop motion animation. I made my first stop motion film called Piplin and then laker the crab slayer, a movie based on how my cousin who killed a crab with a stick 9 years ago(it later turned into a video game).</p>
<h3 class="historytitle">Redram</h3>
<p>After taking heavy inspiration from Pixar, I started my own film studio titled "Redram". The studio was originally supposed to be producing several full length 1 hour long films such as:</p>
<ul style="margin: 10px;">
<li>Girfins Quest - I'll talk more on that later</li>
<li>Comedic Cowboys - Movie about a bunch of cowboys whose careers are chosen by the head of the town. With the problem being the cowboys wanting to be a comedian but cant due to the restrictions of their their career.</li>
<li>Tornado guy/germ guy - pretty obvious, a movie about this guy who gets stuck in a vacuum cleaner and gets germs and becomes a superhero. The other idea was a guy who can use wind to move objects around.</li>
<li>Laker the crab slayer - the original short film turned into a full length movie.</li>
<li>Grey's globe - goofy black and white film that takes place in the 1940s</li>
<li>Grey's globe 2 - goofy black and white film that takes place in the 2000s</li>
</ul>

<p>The studio was later shut down after realizing that I would need 100s of animators and a million dollar budget to be able to make those films. Which meant all my films were cancelled. Although I do hope I can turn some of those ideas into a book or video game.</p>
<h3 class="historytitle">Messydesk is born</h3>
<p>When I started 5th grade, I was learning about order of operations. Which made me want to write a song about the subject. I was thinking of the video being an animation on scratch. Although I haven't really used scratch for a while, so I had to create a new account. I named my account "Messydesk-studios" because of an animation I emailed to someone titled "Animation I made in my <u><b>messy desk</b></u>". Hence the name. I also chose the name because it represents a busy and cluttered mind. <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/749826778/">The PEMDAS animation </a>was never finished(I didn't know how to make songs).</p>

<p>For a while, the messydesk account was used as just a spare account for small little scratch projects such as tag or 3d stuff. I had a friend known as <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Aboomination/">Aboomination</a>. We knew each other in our old school until he left, then we became best friends when I moved to the same school as him. We both discovered our passion for animating and I helped him work on an animation series called Trap Master. It was never finished but it helped develop my skills for animation with the creation of my own lip syncing system which would be used for many of my future animations.</p> 

<h3>The Lucas and Adam show</h3>
<p>Around March of 2023, I was assigned to make a project about oil for my science assessment. Now you could make a poster or essay but you were allowed other media types such as videos. Me and Aboomination both agreed to make an animation. The animation was about oil and was finished in only 2 weeks. The animation was titled "<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/810851398/">The Lucas & Adam show - episode one: oil</a>" which is considered my first true animation. Though the animation may not be as impressive to me now, it was revolutionary back then especially for a 10 year old me. The Lucas and Adam show is still one of the most important animations I've ever worked on. The animation won an award a year later for most outstanding project by an 8-11 year old.</p>

<h3>Websites</h3>
<p>My friend formed a group called the Sus Cringers and later the ROSC. Being in the group was a huge part of my friendships in middle school and also my web design skills. I made a website using google slides for the SC because google sites were too limited, I wanted to take inspiration from newgrounds and used some gradients. Eventually I got so good at designing websites that I planned to make a website of my own that was entirely inspired by 2000s websites called <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Hlu-U4kCny8sHlbr6nJbmyWvDca0oZ9cDIXMW9aQQuk/present?slide=id.p">The Cheesestick society</a>.</p>

<p>The Cheese Stick society was one of my favorite websites that I had the most fun making but was <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-4fu0fQKa3lXyH6nhLsF3w3it6cpa3TCmRqyIj83QYo/present?slide=id.g28615fa5df7_0_6">closed</a> due to inactivity. I contributed to more slidesites such as Aboomistudio and Platsville chat. I eventually tried other platforms but it didn't work well for me. I made 9 websites for <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/904767670/">Platscape OS</a> but scratch wasn't really built for websites. <a href="https://sites.google.com/ismanila.org/nerdcenter/home">Nerd center</a> was like the Cheesestick society except it looked more like a geocities website. Google sites simply were too basic and limited so I tried wix which looked perfect. I can make and publish websites that are actual websites rather than google slides presentations. Although wix was too cluttered, it was too complicated unlike the straight forward google slides that didn't have to ask for my business and location just to make a new website.</p>

<h3>Later animations</h3>
<p>After the success of the Lucas and Adam show, Me and Aboomination was assigned to create another animation about the life cycle of water. Unlike the Lucas and Adam show, the animation was made in a record breaking 4 days and was called <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/856705807/">Adventures of da raindrop boi and water man </a> During summer break, I worked on a video game called Australia man. The project was quickly abandoned but is still planning to be worked on during 2027. 2023 was probably my golden age of scratch since I made so many projects. Here are some of them:</p>
<ul style="margin: 10px;">
<li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/835361608/">Australia be like</a> - Short animation about pests</li>
<li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/871269154/">Color change</a> - animation about the transition from blue to purple in scratch</li>
<li><a href="">With your teeth</a> - An animation meme using audio from a scene in Captain underpants.</li>
<li><a href="">How 2 animate quick and fast</a> - Tutorial about animation. This animation was made for the student short film club. It was my first submission for Bearcat Idol. The film wasn't successful in the talent show but is still one of my favorite animations.</li>
<li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/937581146/">A sound board</a> - just played sound effects when clicked.</li>
<li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/915383409/">Eastime swing</a> -  my first composition</li>
<li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/943981374/">Commercial made about santa in a day</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/874781912/">Add yourself</a> - two animations that contributed to a remix chain</li>
<li>Other test projects - I made a bunch of spare useless projects for design concepts or graphics for future projects such as a <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/851673597/">Lucas and Adam DVD</a> and <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/876989106/">Messydesk+</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Animator Battles</h3>
<p>After months of short animations, me and Aboomistudio were planning on making our next big project. It would be the first episode of a series called the animator battles. The show was about 10 underrated animators who would compete against each other in a stadium to decide who is the best animator. Aboomination and I were planning for this project to be big. We made the characters fighting OC's of actual animators who signed up for the project and we wrote a script for 5 episodes. I even wrote a <a href="animatorbattles.neocities.org">website</a> for the series. The project was planned to be our biggest project. After 6 months of hard work, the animation was finally finished. Only a few of the people who signed up saw it and cared for the animation. It took Aboomination to be aware of it being finished since he only worked on a few scenes. Although it didn't matter because my family loved it! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdZfH6j6ZoM">The Animator Battles</a> may not be my best animation but it is one of my greatest achievements during my tween years. It had fast paced fight scenes, good quality visuals and it was 6 minutes long. I didn't care if it was popular or not, I was very proud of how much I've improved in my animation skills.</p>

<h3>2024</h3>
<p>2024 was my least productive year since I didn't make any major animations besides the animator battles. I started working on a series of fake operating systems called <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/904767670/">Platscape OS</a>. The projects were an imitation of desktops made in scratch and is currently in its 4th version. I've also made a few small projects such as a <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1038062441/">fathers day letter</a>, a birthday animation</a> and a sign up for a series made by only Aboomination about fighting furries. The series was cancelled unfortunately. A few animations I made during that year were <a href="https://www.bitview.net/watch?v=FMJUgkI7">Recursion</a>, a film about people who break the fourth wall and a <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/944887032/">commercial about my former math teacher</a>. I also made a <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/988384901/">trailer for the video game Australia Man</a> which was better than the actual game. I also made a song about a <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/972564734/">carnival</a>m and I made a few games which were unfinished until the summer of 2025 such as: Save your fries which is about stopping people from stealing your fries, trench gunner which is a re-coding of my friend Eleus's video game and a video game about Taylour swift which was requested from my friend Taylor who got made fun of often for having the same name of the singer(the project was taken down by the scratch team). The last project I made in 2024 was called Zbank which was a parody of my family's bank company named Vbank which had recently launched a few weeks prior.</p>

<h3>HTML and the golden age of ROSC</h3>
<p>I made a web website called <a href="https://michaelr67.wixsite.com/platsville">Platsville</a> which was very impressive because unlike google slides, you could log in, post and message people. The website was used by a lot of my classmates which made wix the perfect web hosted service. Although it was limited just like google sites, I couldn't customize the layout to make it look more retro. I was only limited to changing the colors, fonts and border radius etc. Another thing was that it was quite slow and oftentimes only some profiles would load properly.</p>

<p>After seeing the huge flaws in different web hosting services, I decided to use neocities. I've been trying to use neocities for a while but I ditched it easily because I didn't know a lot of html. After reading a book my dad gave me about coding, I properly learned html and tested my skills by making simple tables, divs and webpages. Soon I was fully ready to make a html website all by myself and made a recreation of the <a href="https://aboomistudio.neocities.org/">Aboomistudio website</a>.</p> 

<p>Eventually got good enough to the point where I made a full <a href="https://rosc.neocities.org/">ROSC website</a> with news, directories and a chatroom. The ROSC was now in its golden age after having a fully functional website you could view in your browser. People started asking me to make websites for them such as JSS(which no one used).</p>


<h3>2025</h3>
<p>2025 was much more productive. After discovering <a href="https://penguinmod.com/">Penguinmod</a>, I started working on more advanced projects on the software. I still made a few animations and games in Scratch. During  summer break, I finished all of my unfinished games I made during 2024. This includes <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/937868658/">Save Your Fries</a>, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1080968041/">Trench Gunner</a>, <a href="https://messydesk-studios.itch.io/taylor-swift-the-video-game">Swiftie Shooter</a> and <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1124895653/">Zbank</a>. <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1196096160/">Taylor the crab slayer</a> was a finished and fixed version of a video game that was started when I was 11. The game was based on a video game I made when I was 8, which was based on a stop motion film I mentioned a few paragraphs ago.</p>

<p>1 year prior, my friend Chol-hee made a bet that he can make a full length 1 hour movie about Napoleon on scratch, if he didn't he would buy me 10 fries. Obviously he didn't finish it but he never gave me the 10 fries. Since then, everybody would replace the term "when pigs fly" with "When the Napoleon movie comes out". For Chol-hee's birthday present, I decided I should make an animation for him. But not just any animation, I was gonna make the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1208822878/">Napoleon Movie</a> for him and I was gonna make it 1 hour long just like Chol-hee promised so that everybody who said "When the Napoleon movie comes out" would actually have to do their tasks. The film took me 4:04:19 seconds to make(yes I used a stopwatch) and was actually 1 hour and 15 minutes long. Now you’re probably wondering how I made it that long in only 4 hours. That's because I made a short animation and made the other 73 minutes an animation of Napoleon riding a horse to Waterloo with some additional recorded lines.</p>

<p>The adventures of Raindrop boy was the last animation I made for a school assignment. This was because as I continued through Middle school, tests and Assessments were more serious meaning that I didn't have time to make an animation for any Assessments at the time. That was until Wellness in 8th grade where I got the opportunity to make an animation about my Journey in middle school. The animation took only 3 days to make and was titled <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1213396042/">Road trip through Middle school</a>. I was quite proud of it and the animation was shown to not just the entire class but every other of my teachers' classes.</p>
<h3>The Middle School Musical</h3>
<p>Remember when I mentioned how The Animator Battles was my most impressive but not best animation? Remember when I mentioned how I was barely getting any popularity or views(my most popular animation at the time was only 400 views which I found exciting at the time). Remember when I mentioned how I lost bearcat idol the previous year and I didn't even make it into the finals.</p>

<p>I came up with the idea of the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1157727097/">Middle school musical</a> when I was 10 years old. It was only until 7th grade when I started working on it. I had only 3 weeks so I spent my entire break animating. All of my work was worth it when I published it on scratch. At first it had little to no attention as usual, some nice guy really liked it and made a more appealing thumbnail. I think the thumbnail had quite the contribution to its success. The next day I tried putting it on over 200 studios. It was a good technique for making your project more popular but I never tried it before because it would take too long and most of my projects weren't that good. I spent the entire day adding my project to studios.</p>

<p>I then woke up to 320 messages in scratch. It turns out Incognito Orange loved my projects bringing huge popularity. The next day, I thought it died out but what actually happened was that it was in the "What the community is loving"in the front page. This meant I got messages every 10 seconds. By the next week, it reached 11,100 views which was 37x more than my previous most viewed project. Just when the popularity went down a bit, I ended up winning Bearcat idol and became quite popular.</p>

<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>In the future, I plan to move more into music. After the success of the Middle School Musical and my obsession with the Beatles, I plan to make my very first album using Logic pro with the help of my friend <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6WtGHzz3cImTcrB27vEYJr?si=LQiRWnk8R4KIXrA0uyoT7w">MVP3GOAT</a>. My next animation will be completed by the summer while <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/847742191/">Battletroops</a> is planned to be finished before summer. My main focus for now is this website.</p>

FAQ

<div id="faq">
<b>How did you make this website?</b><br><br>
Using HTML and CSS on Github<br><br>
<b>I can't find the project I'm looking for on your website, where is it?</b><br><br>
If you can't find a certain project on my website, you probably only checked the homepage. The homepage only contains projects that are featured. The projects section or directory has all of my projects.<br><br>
<b>Why don't your characters have pupils?</b><br><br>
When I first designed my avatar in fifth grade, I had to choose between four types of cartoon eyes. The most common ones are eyes with pupils(commonly found in almost every cartoon character), only pupils(commonly found in scratch OC's, stickmen or Riddle School characters) or no pupils(found in Annie comics, Pico school characters or country balls). I chose to have no pupils because I thought it would srtand out more.<br><br>
