<h2>10 reasons why you should use Penguinmod</h2>
<div id="sub" style="width: 100%; margin: 0px 0px 10px 0px; display: flex;"><p styl="color: black; margin: 0;"><b>Written by Lucas Michael</b></p><p style="margin-left: auto; display: block; color: grey;">11/2/2025</p></div>
<h1>1. You can adjust the aspect ratio</h1>
<p>Your projects are no longer limited to an outdated 4:3 aspect ratio. Penguinmod allows you to use widescreen and custom ratios to fit your monitor. </p>
<h1>2. The ability to use turbowarp addons</h1>
<p>Penguinmod comes with a variety of useful addons from either scratch addons or turbowarp. These include the ability to organize your sprites into a folder, editor snapping, block switching and a video recorder to help export animations or in-game footage as a video file.</p>
<h1>3. Project packager</h1>
<p>Just like turbowarp, you can be able to package your project as an html file or as a Mac or Windows application. This is useful for sharing your games to the public.</p>
<h1>4. Awesome projects</h1>
<p>Penguinmod has a variety of awesome, fun and impressive projects shared by other people. This can help for inspiration and ideas for a project.</p>
<h1>5. Community wiki</h1>
<p>The Penguinmod community thankfully provides a community wiki that gives information and details on the software. This can help guide and inform beginners or scratch users on how the software works differently.</p>

<p>Now a lot of these reasons are features already included in either turbowarp or scratch. But the next 5 reasons are features extremely useful and are exclusive to only penguinmod.</p>

<h1>6. Monetization</h1>
<p>Unlike scratch, you can legally monetize your penguinmod projects through github or patreon. This can help financially support penguinmod creators.</p>

<h1>7. Custom fonts</h1>
<p>Penguinmod allows you to upload custom fonts when designing or adding words. This can make your project more unique and makes it look less like a scratch project.</p>

<h1>8. Custom variables</h1>
<p>This feature allows you to make your project look less like a scratch project, helps blend in variables with your design and theme and allows you to change your text through code rather than manually changing it in costumes. This removal of the restriction to an orange monitor can lead to more possibilities.</p>
<h1>9. Over 170 new blocks</h1>
<p>Penguinmod's offers a variety of more blocks that allows new possibilities, allows new functions and makes coding easier and less limited. These new blocks include a when condition block, point towards _x _y block, run green flag block, if key hit? block, scrolling? block, loads of more operators such as greater than or equal to and so much more. </p>
<h1>10. The extensions</h1>
<p>The extensions probably have to be the best reason to use penguinmod. You will deeply appreciate these features if you have experience on scratch. Unlike the limited extensions in scratch such as pen, instruments and face tracking, penguinmod has much more extensions. There are even more extensions from other websites such as sharkpool and turbowarp.</p>

<p>I could spend an hour talking about the extensions but I will list the best ones instead. The stage camera allows you to zoom in, zoom out and move around the stage which is especially useful for platformers. Griffpatch developed his own physics extension. Category expansions are a collection of extensions that offer even more blocks such as a warp block for looks which is useful for 3d engines. Iframe allows you to embed websites. File sharing allows you to download files directly from the project. Animated text allows you to use coding to display text with custom colors and fonts. Finally, the extension maker allows you to use javascript to make your very own extension making the possibilities truly endless. </p>
