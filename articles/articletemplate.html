<p>On October 15, 2025, Arguements and political tensions between Eleus and Chol-hee. During the Fall elections, Chol-hee was giving a second chance to become a good president after Eleus's retirement. Chol-hee was often critizied for not doing any development or improvements in the economy.</p><br>

<p>Chol-hee was also upsetting citizens due to giving people J*b applications and no pay of Double stuffed Oreos. This arguement escelated to the point where everyone was yelling at each other and Chol-hee has "Chilli flakes in his eyes". That was until Jacob questioned the fact of having a president in the first place.
</p><br>

<p>The political system was meant for role play and fun in order to make the group more interesting. Until Eleus and Chol-hee took it too seriously and argued about fake politics to the point where it interfered with their real life friendship. Later that day after a voting Chol-hee wanted to end the presidential system after he finishes his term but everyone else wanted to end it now. After that, the presidential system ended after 2 years. Chol-hee had messed up a few times but was given a second chance. Although that second chance lead to worse effects with Chol-hee being so bad at being president to the point where they had to shut down the entire political system. Ever since then, Chol-hee had lost complete trust from the group.</p><br>
