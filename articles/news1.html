<h2>New Messydesk Website!</h2>
<div id="sub" style="width: 100%; margin: 0px 0px 10px 0px; display: flex;"><p styl="color: black; margin: 0;"><b>Written by Lucas Michael</b></p><p style="margin-left: auto; display: block; color: grey;">10/31/2025</p></div>
<p>November 1-3 will be the day the messydesk website is finally finished. Many new features have already been implemented, and more are expected to be added tomorrow. You're probably wondering why it took this long to make a Messydesk website. After all, I have been working on an uncountable number of websites on Google Slides and Neocities.</p><br>

<p>We'll there was never really a Slidesite for Messydesk-studios because the main website I used to share videos was actually Aboomistudio. After the breakup of Aboomistudio, I decided to make websites on Wix. It was supposed to be an exciting movement away from slide-sites, but miserably failed, and slide-sites were still being used. This was mainly because I primarily found Wix frustrating. It was very limited, clunky, complicated, and took sooo long to load. Unlike Google Slides, which doesn't need to ask for your phone number and "company view" just to make another project. Oh yes, and don't forget that stupid watermark on the top. The move away from slide-sites happened during the ROSC HTML revolution. Although the problem was that I was the only one who knew HTML, so only I could edit it. Slidesites are still used, but the ROSC HTML website is still alive and thriving.
</p><br>

<p>The first attempt at an HTML website was when I had little knowledge, and the website was very ugly since the ui's didn't match. 
You can view it <a href="https://messydesk.neocities.org/old">here.</a>. The second attempt had a more boring homepage since the front page was mostly text copied and pasted from the ROSC website. Around later in May, I finally made a third version, which was inspired by the <a href="https://michaelr67.wixsite.com/messydesk">original Wix version</a>. The new homepage had a layout inspired by the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NeUY6cPaQG2MxmwRHQtBdLeUhUuem7vlaC6sH6OSx-Q/present?slide=id.g742bc7a81330fef8_1">Aboomistudio homepage</a>. It had updates in the sidebar and a banner in the main with featured videos and games under. The new design used a semi-graduated theme, which made the website stand out from other slidesites and websites I've made.
</p><br>

<p>The website had all the pages complete, but still had a few unfinished elements. The biggest change added this week is the projects page. Rather than having separate pages for separate categories, they can all be accessed through one page and their organised into subpages by not just videos and games but also websites, music, etc. The very first finished version of messydesk.neocities.org will be completed around this week.</p>
