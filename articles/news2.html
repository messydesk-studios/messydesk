<h2>Messydesk Neocities Website End of Support</h2>
</div>
<div id="sub" style="width: 100%; margin: 0px 0px 10px 0px; display: flex;"><p styl="color: black; margin: 0;"><b>Written by Lucas Michael</b></p><p style="margin-left: auto; display: block; color: grey;">1/6/2026</p></div>
<p>Today on January 6, the Messydesk neocities website will be discontinued and be moved to github under the messydesk.online domain.</p><br>

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Several days ago, I claimed ownership of www.messydesk.online. I spent quite some time figuring out how to move my files to github but eventually it worked. I did this so that it would be easier for people to access my website due to its simple and short domain. Messydesk.com was already taken but .online was good enough. Everytime I tell people about my website and say the url, they always seem to misspell it.<br><br>
Most people misspell neocities as neocitys or neelcities
others say messydesk studios or messydesk.org
One person mispelled org as gore and got traumatised.<br><br>

To avoid confusion, I decided to just get my own domain
</p><br>

<h3>What benefits will come?</h3>
<p>Neocities is mostly limited because it only supports front-end development meaning that I can't use php or mysql. Switching to github under my domain allows me to use php, make the website more interactive and break free from several limitations.</p><br>

<p>Future websites will be under a subdomain for example "platsville.messydesk.online". This means that projects that include back-end development like Bob's Marketplace can finally be released and used by others. This also allows for future projects such as a php version of my social media site Platsville.</p>

<h3>Anything Else?</h3>
<p>I don't think I'm going to be using neocities anymore except for ROSC. It is truly a one of a kind web hosting service that helped bring back fun to the internet just like geocities did. Neocities is and always will be an important part of my coding journey.</p>

<p>Although, I am very excited about my new website and I hope to see you there on</p>
