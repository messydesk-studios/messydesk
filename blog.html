<b>Jan 8 2026</b>
Around Christmas, I received a new computer for Christmas. The computer in question is a raspberry pi. Now my friends say that a Raspberry Pi isn't fully a PC but thats probably because their PC's are like the size of like a shelf. I'm very glad I have a Raspberry Pi because I can finally use a linux and customize it to look like a Windows XP which is the closest thing to having one.
Its only 4GB of Ram but thats fine because its good enough to run Minecraft and Penguinmod projects. It may not be as powerful as my Macbook nor can it run Assasins Creed Shadows without blowing up my PC but its good enough to run software that I will normally use for productivity. 
Another reason why I'm going to use my Raspberry pi more often is because I can finally have a seperate computer for personal use rather than storing my animations and games on my school laptop. I could just get an actual PC but a Raspberry Pi doesn't take up much space, it can run TwisterOS which has a very accurate Windows XP theme which can motivate me to code more and the softwares I use don't take up too much power unlike video editing softwares.

New year new domain! 
I'm so exited about the new domain. I can finally use my php skills and share my projects that coudn't be released on neocities.

Wow! Who would've known that my first blog post I make straight after 2025 and just after finishing my website would be me leaving the website straight away. After receiving the ownership of messydesk.online, I finally figured out how to move my files to the domain. This means that the neocities website will become inactive but not deleted for archival purposes. I'm going to miss neocities, I will see you in my new website!

"I can't beleive that 2025 is already ending, it wen't by so fast!!!!!!<img src="https://s.yimg.com/fz/api/res/1.2/95WcmywsSwl2Sr0l3J6iEA--~C/YXBwaWQ9c3JjaGRkO2ZpPWZpbGw7aD00MTI7cHhvZmY9NTA7cHlvZmY9MTAwO3E9ODA7c3M9MTt3PTM4OA--/https://i.pinimg.com/736x/1a/80/38/1a80388f8b2c73889ef4ec9157822984.jpg" width="20">
That's pretty much what everybody is thinking right now before new years. I think it's because either they were having such a blast in 2025 that they didn't care what time of the year it was or they probably forgot about what happened in between New Years and today besides important events. This is just like how I felt like I finished 7th grade in a brisk and that was probably because 7th grade was much more interesting than the other grades, that I didn't care about how many days until summer break.<br><br>

If I were to look back, I think it would be the first reason. I just felt much more productive this year especially compared to 2024 where most of what I did after the animator battles was just watch youtube and did nothing else. I've finally finished a few abandoned projects, created a musical and most importantly finished this website just before Christmas. I'm hoping for the next year to be just as good and I probably might start working on a few things with MVP3GOAT. For the blog, I hope to make my posts more exciting and interesting. Rather than just giving a summary on a few changes I made to this website, I want to go more into my thoughts and opinions. I hope to make it feel more like I'm narrating a movie or maybe those popular novels that are shown in the form of a Journal. Enough Yap, I'll be back next year!<br>

I woke up today after a very long Christmas Eve and for the first time, there was no presents under the Christmas tree for me. At first I was shocked but I didn't realy mind. My Christmas gift yesterday was having the ownership of Messydesk.online. This means that I might stop using neocities and start moving my website to under my own domain.<br>

Today is Christmas Eve which is why I decided that until Christmas ends, I can only watch and play something related to Christmas. So what better way to spend the rest of my free time before my family dinner than playing Elf Bowling on the GBA.<br>

This is it. I’m done, I am finally done. You know, after 2 years of designing countless websites for people groups that each mark memorable parts of my life, I’ve never made a single completed website for myself. Most of them were just managed by me, maybe had a different name or shared with other people. But this ends now. I’ve made three failed attempts on making a website. The fourth attempt hasn’t failed but instead has been constantly ignored with continuous delays and an abundance of procrastination. Most of the time I would do slight improvements for an entire day adding new features. Now, all of this work has finally become worth it as I have finally finished my very first full and complete<br><br>

<b style="font-size: 20px;">Messydesk-studios website</b><br><br>

More features may come soon but I’ve finished everything I’ve needed now. From now on, this website will be constantly updated with new articles, blogs and projects and will be kept as an e-portfolio for others to view. As of December 23, 2025, the website has been officially opened!!!!! Enjoy!

During the afternoon, I was adding a few more parts to my about page. Something that has been bugging me was the grammatical and spelling errors. To make the site look more professional, I used autocorrect to correct spelling and grammar mistakes from my blog, news articles and articles. I will grammar correct the about page once I finish it.<br>

Around this morning, the scratch team removed some content from my profile. They removed links to my website since I'm not allowed to share personal info which makes sense. Although they removed my face test project only because the thumbnail showed a picture of my face covered with cartoon eyes. This kind of makes sense but I didn;t show my full face. The removal that makes the most sense is the deletion of my Swiftie shooter game. Which makes 100% sense since the game incites violence.<br>

School's started now. I know that I haven't made a post since the stone age but I'm working on a few things.<br>

School is finally finished! I hope this summer break gives me enough time to work on the website. Although there has been a recent problem with the ROSC website. Every time I try to update something, it takes more than a day to update.<br>

I officially have less than a week until school ends. I'm very excited. Once summer break starts, I will be working on the website more often. I will be giving some updates to complete the website such as finishing the history, finishing the directory, updating the blog, updating the videos and games, add a new article and even add a shop :o<br>

Tomorrow is my birthday party, I'm really excited. also I won bearcat idol :D<br>

<b>April 11 2025</b><br>
It's been a while since I blogged something. I finished my song for bearcat idol, I just need to make a few edits then work on the animation. I only have to weeks left, so I'm going to have to make a proper plan so I don't stress over it.<br>

I'm currently working on a new version of my social network, Platsville. Although I'm currently trying to find which server to use. Originally I was going to use ruby on rails, although you're gonna need a terminal to install it(I don't trust the terminal). Then I was going to use buddypress, but apparently you need to pay in order to use it. Abyss server is good, but I don't know if it's built for making a social network. My only option left is Elgg: It's free, You don't need a terminal and it's built for social networks. There's only one small problem: HOW THE HECK DO I USE THIS!?!?!??!! Everything is so confusing and I can't find a tutorial.<br>

Trying to learn python by making a game called "ISM simulator" an interactive text-based choose your own adventure. Although I'm a noob and I'm struggling with a lot of glitches. So I asked for help from a classmate who's an expert at Python. He can't fix the glitch either. So I gave the idea to my classmate and let him make it into his own game instead(I just hope he credits me).<br>

Today is my last day before heading off to my family trip, which is why I'm trying to be as productive as possible. Unfortunately I can't work on the Middle school Musical right now because my friend isn't online, so I'm gonna wait until next week. In the meantime, I'm adding more updates to my Taylor Swift video game. I added code to make the game more difficult every 5 seconds to make it more challenging for the player.<br>

<b>My first blog post!</b> - February 26 2025<br>
